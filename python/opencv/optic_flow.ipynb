    "### Optical Flow \n",
    "optical flow refers to the apparent motion of the object due to the relative motion of the object or the observer, it creats 2D vectors that determines the change in the position of the pixels from one frame to another, it uses the change in the intensity of the pixel to calculate the motion of the pixel, thus it assumes that the intensity of the pixel remain constant over a very short time interval as it moves across the image plane. \n",

    "f I(x,y,t) is the intensity of a pixel at coordinates (x,y) at time t, and this pixel moves to (x+dx,y+dy) at time t+dt, then:\n",

    "It is a sparse optical flow algorithm which assumes that the optical flow (u,v) is approximately constant within a small local neighborhood around the pixel under consideration. thus the value of U and V would be the same for a neighborhood of pixels, it first uses the She-Tomasi corner detection or GoodPrevious_pointToTrack to determine important Previous_point then take a 3Ã—3 window (9 pixels) around a central pixel, then all 9 pixels in that window are assumed to have the same (u,v) velocity vector. Thus we can then calculate the value of U and V using 9 pixels."
